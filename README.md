# Linear-Regression-for-Real-State
Linear Regression model to identify features that have influence in final price, and model with high predictive capacity.

Data base

The dataset describes the sale of individual residential properties in an American city from 2006 to 2010. The dataset contains 2930 observations and a large number of features (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete and 20 continuous) involved in the evaluation of the value of the properties, that is, there are 80 explanatory variables.

Generally, the 20 continuous features are related to various area dimensions for each property. In addition to the typical lot size and total square footage of the living area, other more specific variables are quantified in the dataset. Measurements of the basement area, living room area and even the balconies are present and divided into individual categories based on quality and type. The large number of continuous variables in this dataset should provide many opportunities for discretization and building new features.

The 14 discrete features typically quantify the number of items that exist in the house. Like, for example: the number of kitchens, bedrooms and bathrooms discretized by their location (basement or above ground). Additionally, garage capacity and construction/renovation dates are also recorded.

Nominal features typically identify various categories of housing, garages, materials, and environmental conditions, while ordinal variables typically classify various items on the property.
